# StoreAppDemo

This is a typical online store application following MVC pattern and basic javascript and Jquery.
No actual database is used and data comes from a predefined XML. However, as XML processing is done in different layer, it is easily replaceable with some database services.
This project is a typical example of MVC pattern and Razor syntax.
